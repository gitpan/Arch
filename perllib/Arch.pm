=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Arch-Perl library allows Perl developers to create GNU Arch front-ends
in an object oriented fashion. GNU Arch is a decentralized, changeset-oriented
revision control system.

Currently, a pragmatic high-level interface is built around tla.
This functionality was initially developed for ArchZoom project,
and was highly enhanced to serve AXP and ArchWay projects as well.
